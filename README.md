# team Saudi Falcons (wro) future engineers
## Description:-
#### The Saudi Falcons have only had one objective since they were founded. utilizing the combined power of collaboration, artificial intelligence, mechanical, and electricity in a single vehicle. We perfected our self-driving car to be as autonomous and effective as it can be by carefully choosing the proper components, carefully examining every line of its code, putting in the work, and trying again and again.

Finding a means to make all of these components work together nicely without interfering with any dynamic is probably the most challenging part. Choosing the proper components is a really difficult phase because we want our car to be as amazing as its potential can deliver.

Weâ€™re working with a vehicle that is built with Three ultrasonic sensors for measuring distance from three directions ,a color sensor to detect the colors on the mattress , an artificial intelligence camera with multiple programs, color and object recognition , an interactive screen for displaying the camera view, a servo motor for steering to control the direction of the robot,a differential mechanism to transfer power from one motor to two wheels ,a lightweight aluminum body ,a 12V rechargeable lithium battery, a board compatible with Arduino,a separate motor drive control , Motors with a speed of 300 rpm , Wide rubber wheel .

We carefully built our code by scrutinizing each and every line of code to ensure that no errors or software bugs were present. By preparing two codes, we ensured that each problem isn't decided by chance but rather by our prior planning.
